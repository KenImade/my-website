Hey there! I'm Kenneth. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to wear many hats: from Mechanical Engineering to Business Analytics, and from Process Engineering to Machine Learning. My academic journey started at Covenant University, Nigeria, where I honed my foundational engineering skills. Following a stint as a Process Engineer intern at Chevron, I discovered a penchant for data and technology. This passion led me to a transformative role at Verraki Africa, where I immersed myself in the realm of business analytics.

During my time at Verraki Africa, I dove deep into data, optimizing, and cleansing thousands of data points and testing a web application. But it's not just about the data for me; communication is key. I found joy in translating complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders, bridging gaps and fostering collaboration.

Further enriching my knowledge, I pursued an MSc in Business Analytics and Decision Sciences from the esteemed University of Leeds. Here, my project on Initial Coin Offering Prediction and my upcoming dissertation on Optimizing Real Estate valuation models with textual data are testimonies to my growing expertise in this field.

I've also been privileged to be a part of Omdena, where I spearheaded a data cleaning team and worked collaboratively to improve data processing speeds.

On the tech side, my strengths lie in backend web development, complementing my prowess in data analytics. I'm adept in programming languages like R, Python, and JavaScript, and have a strong handle on tools such as Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

Outside of the professional sphere, I've passionately participated in the UBC Global Masterâ€™s Competition, collaborating with peers and strategizing holistically for business solutions.

My story is one of continuous learning, adaptability, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. From intricate data analysis to crafting seamless web experiences, my journey has been a blend of engineering, analytics, and web development. Feel free to explore my work, and let's connect!

But data aside, I'm always up for a friendly chat, swapping tech stories, or discussing the latest in the world of analytics. Let's connect, collaborate, and create!
