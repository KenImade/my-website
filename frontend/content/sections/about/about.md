Hey there! I'm Kenneth. ðŸš€

Born with an engineer's brain (shoutout to my Mech Eng days at Covenant University!), my journey led me from the mechanics of machines to the magic of data. While I've explored the intricate designs of mechanical systems, it was the pulse and patterns of data that truly resonated with me. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into this fascination at the University of Leeds, studying Business Analytics and Decision Sciences.

My adventures have taken me to boardrooms at Verraki Africa, where I played detective with diverse data points, to Chevron, where I added a touch of tech to crude oil extraction. I've even had the joy of leading a squad of fellow data lovers at Omdena, a playground for AI aficionados like me.

When I'm not knee-deep in data or forecasting the next big trend, Iâ€™m probably collaborating on some global challenge or sharpening my skills with the latest tech tool. Or, you might just catch me exploring new strategies for Initial Coin Offerings or predicting the next hot real estate market. (Yep, data really is everywhere in my world!)

But data aside, I'm always up for a friendly chat, swapping tech stories, or discussing the latest in the world of analytics. Let's connect, collaborate, and create!
