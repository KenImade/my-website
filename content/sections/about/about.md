Hello! I'm Kenneth Imade, a data enthusiast rooted deeply in the world of data science and analytics. With a background spanning across continents and industries, my journey began in Lagos, Nigeria, where I honed my skills as a Business Analyst at Verraki Africa, diving deep into market research and automating data-driven processes. My passion for solving real-world challenges led me to collaborate on AI solutions with a global team at Omdena, where I embraced the multifaceted nature of machine learning.

My academic journey at the University of Leeds, UK, where I pursued a Master's in Business Analytics and Decision Sciences, has fortified my technical acumen, allowing me to craft accurate predictive models and optimize data processes. Not just limited to numbers, I take pride in translating complex data narratives into understandable insights, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Outside the world of data, I'm a continuous learner, an advocate for collaboration, and always eager to tackle the next big challenge. With every dataset, I see a story waiting to be told, and I'm here to narrate it.

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out. Let's turn data into action together!
